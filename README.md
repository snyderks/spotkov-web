# Spotkov - Web Server

View at [https://spotkov.kristiansnyder.com](https://spotkov.kristiansnyder.com).

A web wrapper of [Spotkov](https://github.com/snyderks/spotkov).
For everyone who doesn't want to go and get her own API keys for Spotify and Last.FM but still wants generated playlists.

Spotkov takes your play history in Last.FM and creates a playlist starting with a song you like and hopefully following it up with others you like too!
